  ```powershell
  cd server
  npm run server
  ```
  Look for: `listening on port 9208`

- [ ] Client is running
  ```powershell
  cd client
  npm run dev
  ```
  Look for: `ready in XXXms`

- [ ] Browser console is open
  ```
  F12 → Console tab
  ```

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Verify Server is Accessible
In browser address bar, visit:
```
http://localhost:9208/signer
```

✅ Expected: You see an Ethereum address displayed
❌ If error: Server not running or port blocked

### Step 2: Open Web3 Game
In browser address bar, visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

✅ Expected: Dark background with "CONNECT WALLET" button
❌ If blank: See SETUP_GUIDE.md troubleshooting

### Step 3: Open DevTools Console
Press: **F12**

Go to: **Console** tab

You should see these logs:
```
[Scene] StartScene created
[Scene] StartScene ready
```

✅ If you see these: Console is working
❌ If you don't: Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R)

### Step 4: Click "CONNECT WALLET" Button

**Watch the Console**

You should see:
```
[Button] Connect button clicked
[Button] No signer yet, starting wallet connection...
[Wallet] Starting wallet connection...
[Wallet] MetaMask available: true
```

✅ If you see "MetaMask available: true": Good!
❌ If you see "MetaMask available: false": Install MetaMask extension

### Step 5: Web3Modal Should Appear

A dialog showing wallet options should popup:
- MetaMask
- WalletConnect
- Other wallets

✅ Click your wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
❌ If popup doesn't appear: Check browser blocked popups

### Step 6: Wallet Connection Window

MetaMask window will open asking to connect

✅ Click "Next" → "Connect"
❌ If blocked: Allow popups for localhost:3000

### Step 7: Watch Console for Success

You should see:
```
[Wallet] Provider connected: EIP1193Provider
[Wallet] ethers provider created
[Wallet] Signer obtained
[Wallet] Connected wallet address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc0e7c1E5cEe6f
[Button] Signer obtained successfully
```

✅ Great! Wallet connected
❌ If error: Note the exact error message

### Step 8: Button Should Change to "login"

The button text changes from "connect wallet" to "login"

Status text shows: "wallet connected"

✅ Success!
❌ If not: Check console for errors (Step 7)

### Step 9: Click Button Again (Now Shows "login")

The scene will ask you to sign a message

MetaMask will show a signature request popup

✅ Click "Sign"
❌ Click "Cancel" if you want to retry

### Step 10: Watch Console for Authentication

You should see:
```
[Auth] Starting authentication...
[Auth] Got address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc0e7c1E5cEe6f
[Auth] Server host: http://localhost:9208
[Auth] Fetching challenge from server...
[Auth] Got challenge from server
[Auth] Generated typed data
[Auth] Requesting signature from wallet...
[Auth] Signature obtained
[Auth] Authentication successful, switching to CONNECT_SCENE
```

✅ If you see this: **FULL SUCCESS** 🎉

### Step 11: Should Switch to Next Scene

After signing, the scene should change

You should see a "logging in to server..." message

This means authentication worked!
